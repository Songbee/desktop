<h4 align="center">Post-cloud music streaming</h4>

---

Songbee will be a post-cloud music streaming app, similar
to [Spotify][] or [Deezer][]. The key difference is: it's free and
decentralized, powered by peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent.

**Status:** streams music from torrent files (given there are enough seeds).

## Install

<!--
### Prebuilt

Download for [Windows]() and [macOS]().

#### Linux

On Debian/Ubuntu, add the Electron Packages repo:

```
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.epkg.in/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/epkg.list"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install songbee
```

On other distributions (or if you can't add repositories), [download this AppImage].

### From Git
-->
(Prebuilt packages coming soon!)

Install MPV globally (`brew install mpv` on macOS, [various repos][mpv-repos] on Linux, but no idea about Windows), then:

```
git clone https://github.com/Songbee/desktop && cd desktop
yarn            # or `npm install`, but it's not recommended
yarn run build  # or `npm run build`
yarn start      # or `npm start`
```


## FAQ-like section

### Why?
Why not?

### But this is piracy!
Technically, this violates the DMCA, you're right. However, we will cover
for that with optional Bitcoin-powered donations. This would work much like
[Flattr][]: say, you pay $10 per month and listen to Ruby My Dear tracks
15 times and to [sabufaizu][] 20 times this month. Ruby My Dear gets
$10 * (15/35) = $4.28 and sabufaizu gets the rest.

### If the donations are optional, nobody would donate!
Those who don't want to pay wouldn't have paid if Songbee didn't exist.

### Still, this is illegal. Music labels will sue you!
Yeah, well, look at the [Popcorn Time][].

### Okay, copyright fighter, so what's the license?
[Unlicense][]. I wanted to use MIT, but it doesn't really make sense.
