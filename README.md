# Songbee

Songbee will be a post-cloud music streaming app, similar
to [Spotify][] or [Deezer][]. The key difference is: it's free and
decentralized, powered by peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent.

**Status:** nothing works yet. We have an (un-)fancy UI, though.


### Why?

Why not?

### But this is piracy!

Technically, this violates the DMCA, you're right. However, we will cover
for that with optional Bitcoin-powered donations. This would work much like
[Flattr][]: say, you pay $10 per month and listen to Ruby My Dear tracks
15 times and to [sabufaizu][] 20 times this month. Ruby My Dear gets
$10 * (15/35) = $4.28 and sabufaizu gets the rest.

### If the donations are optional, nobody would donate!

Those who don't want to pay wouldn't have paid if Songbee didn't exist.

### Still, this is illegal. Music labels will sue you!

Yeah, well, look at the [Popcorn Time][].

### Okay, copyright fighter, so what's the license?

[Unlicense][]. I wanted to use MIT, but it doesn't really make sense.
