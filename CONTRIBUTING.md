Contributing
=============

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to Songbee. Thank you very much! Open source projects live-and-die based on the support they receive from others, and the fact that you're even considering contributing to our project is very generous of you.

Songbee is a community-driven project. As such, we welcome and encourage all sorts of contributions. They include, but are not limited to:

- Constructive feedback
- Questions about usage
- [Bug reports / technical issues](#filing-issues)
- Documentation changes
- Feature requests
- [Pull requests](#filing-pull-requests)

We strongly suggest that before filing an issue, you search through the existing issues to see if it has already been filed by someone else.


## Filing Issues

If you are opening an issue about a bug, make sure that you include clear steps for how we can reproduce the problem. _If we can't reproduce it, we can't fix it._ If you are suggesting a feature, make sure your explanation is clear and detailed.


## Filing Pull Requests

For now there isn't much routine for you to do. Sometime we'll have tests, docs, [a changelog][] and lots of other fancy neat stuff. For now there are just a few things to keep in mind:

- **Coding style:** tl;dr: double quotes and semicolons. _“In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.”_
- **License:** (see below)

### License

This project is [unlicensed][]. If you want to contribute, you have to sign the Copyright wavier. Fortunately, it's a matter of seconds as we use the [CLA assistant][] — it will provide instructions on your first pull request.
